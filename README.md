# Miner Guild 
## an on chain mining pool for Provably Rare Gem

tl;dr - mine for the pool -> submit good salt to prove your work to the pool -> get hash provider token (HP-token) aka share of the pool.
at any point in time - you can claim your share of the pool to get wrapped gem. (limilar to how LP-token work)

## todo - write readme.
